# Welcome

[English verison - Full](https://github.com/V-a-k-y-r-i-e/server-docs/blob/main/welcome/welcome.md) - [Deutsche Verison - Full](https://github.com/V-a-k-y-r-i-e/server-docs/blob/main/welcome/wilkommen.md)

## **Who are we?**

Although we are a mostly German speaking Clan, we invite anyone to join us and have fun gaming and/or studying.
We play various casual games like WoW, Hots, Overwatch, Minecraft, WoT, Warframe, Destiny and many other.

This Server aims to be a meritocracy by awarding roles (and therefore privileges) through activity.
The highest ranking member also is the server owner. And administrative decisions will only be made if the majority of all single-digit-rank members agree.

## **Rules:**

- Agree to disagree.
- No illegal content.
- No linking to other servers.
- Bot commands only under #bot.
- No Spoilers, or mark them as such.
- No exploiting loopholes in the rules (please report them).

## Where do I start?

If this Guild sounds like it is something you'd like and you are fine with the rules you can start your journey by reacting with ðŸš€ to this message!

After you have done this you will be granted the first of our three tiers (lowest, middle and highest order respectively). You will gain additional privileges with each additional tier.

To advance in tiers you will need to [level up](https://github.com/Sntx626/Yggdrasil-Experience/blob/yggdrasil/README.md), with every 10 levels you will advance your role (from `Angel (I)` to `Valkyr`(X)) and every three roles will advance you one tier.
